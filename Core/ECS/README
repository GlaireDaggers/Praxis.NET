This folder contains the underlying ECS implementation used by the Praxis game engine

This implementation is HEAVILY based on MoonTools.ECS (https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/MoonTools.ECS), both in terms of being a nearly drop-in
replacement of it (since Praxis previously used it, I wanted to replace it with minimal changes), as well as heavily borrowing the structure & algorithms.

There are a couple of key differences - the main one is that instead of using native memory to allocate structures, I'm using existing pure C# structures
instead. The reason for this is because MoonTools.ECS's architecture requires that components, messages, relations, etc be unmanaged structs. Unfortunately,
this poses significant challenges in terms of referring to managed objects. The recommended approach is to use some kind of object handle system where the
component struct gets a lightweight integer handle and the actual object is stored elsewhere, but I quickly found this approach to be both unwieldy and
error-prone.

There's a couple of places I'm probably going to be paying a performance penalty for this, but it is what it is. I think I value the usability of simply being allowed to refer directly to managed objects over the slight speed increase of avoiding some casts.

Compressonator is a set of tools to allow artists and developers to more easily work with compressed assets and easily visualize the quality impact of various compression technologies.  It consists of a GUI application, a command line application, and an SDK for easy integration into a developer toolchain.

A variety of block based codecs, palletized and grayscale encoders, and useful tools for generating mip-maps, comparing the quality of compressed and uncompressed images and batch-compressing large databases of images are included.

Developers and texture artists can optimize the level of quality and performance that best suits the requirements for their game assets and pipeline. Textures are compressed according to specific data streaming requirements, balancing both power and memory of the targeted devices while maintaining quality that users expect.

The most popular codecs are provided in a comprehensive easy to use library with a simple  interface that can be integrated into game engines and tools.

Compressonator supports Microsoft Windows®, Linux and Mac builds.
